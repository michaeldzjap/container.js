# container.js
The Laravel service container re-written in TypeScript

This project is still in its early stages. The container has been fully implemented and the full container test suite from the _Laravel_ version has been ported to _Jest_. They all pass at the moment. However, the project has not yet been used in a real project yet and the _TypeScript_ part probably could be improved upon still.
